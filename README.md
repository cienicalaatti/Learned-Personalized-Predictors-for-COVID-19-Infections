Bachelor's thesis.

Abstract:
COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most influential health crises of the recent
history. During the pandemic, health care organizations have been faced with chal-
lenges related to infection tracking, diagnosing and care prioritization. Many of these
operations produce and require different types of data. Analysing the data is key in
optimizing these processes, thus making machine learning a viable tool in solving
these problems.
The objective of this thesis was to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-
19 was hospitalized based on health data. To achieve this, three different supervised
machine learning models were trained and evaluated: logistic regression, support
vector machines, and gradient boosting. The data used in the analysis was a patient-
level symptom information dataset provided by the Centers of Disease Control and
Prevention. The dataset included over 30 million datapoints with patient-level data,
including hospitalization status, whether the patient was deceased because of the
illness, along with demographic and symptoms information.
The most important evaluation metric used in the analysis was the F1-score.
Out of the three candidate models, the gradient boosting model achieved the best
F1-score of 0.574. The corresponding F1-scores for logistic regression and support
vector machines were 0.504 and 0.521, respectively.
Predicting the need for hospitalization proved a challenging machine learning
problem using supervised methods. Nevertheless, the models studied in this thesis
had meaningful predictive power. Given the results from this thesis along with related,
previous studies, it can be concluded that supervised machine learning methods can
be successfully applied to problems similar to the one of this thesis.
